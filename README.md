# RedVsBlue
Using a Kali Linux machine to exploit a vulnerable host and then capture the logs from the events and analyze it on a SIEM tool. For the Red team side Nmap, Metasploit, and MFSVenom were used to gain full access to the vulnerable machine.  The Blue side of the project focused on understanding the Logs generated and creating new alerts to monitor for an attack in the future as well as suggestions and plans for hardening the vulnerable machine.
